# TableTransforms.jl - Summer of Code

[TableTransforms.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/TableTransforms.jl) provides transforms that are commonly
used in statistics and machine learning. It was developed to address specific needs in feature engineering
and works with general Tables.jl tables.

Project mentors: [JÃºlio Hoffimann](https://github.com/juliohm)

## Statistical transforms

Statistical transforms such as PCA, Z-score, etc, can greatly improve the convergence of various statistical
learning models, and are widely used in advanced machine learning pipelines. In this project the mentee will
learn how to implement advanced transforms such as PPMT and other transforms for imputation of missing values.

**Desired skills:** Statistics, Machine Learning

**Difficulty level:** Medium

**Expected duration:** 350hrs

## Utility transforms

Utility transforms such as standardization of column names and other string-based transforms are extremely important
for digesting real-world data. In this project the mentee will learn good coding practices and will implement various
utility transforms available in other languages (e.g. Janitor package in R, pyjanitor in Python).

**Desired skills:** Text processing, Regex

**Difficulty level:** Easy
