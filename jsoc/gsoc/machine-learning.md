#  Machine Learning Projects - Summer of Code

### CUDA Hacking

Time: 175h

Are you a performance nut? This project is aimed at expanding our coverage of high performance kernels and libraries widely used across machine learning workflows. 

#### Expected Outcomes

Help us implement cutting-edge CUDA kernels in Julia for operations important across deep learning, scientific computing and more. We also need help developing our wrappers for machine learning, sparse matrices and more, as well as CI and infrastructure. Contact us to develop a project plan.

Mentors: [Tim Besard](https://github.com/maleadt), [Dhairya Gandhi](https://github.com/DhairyaLGandhi).

### Reinforcement Learning Environments

Time: 175h

Develop a series of reinforcement learning environments, in the spirit of the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com). Although we have wrappers for the gym available, it is hard to install (due to the Python dependency) and, since it's written in Python and C code, we can't do more interesting things with it (such as differentiate through the environments).

#### Expected Outcome

A pure-Julia version of selected environments that supports a similar API and visualisation options would be valuable to anyone doing RL with Flux.

Mentors: [Dhairya Gandhi](https://github.com/DhairyaLGandhi/).

### Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Recent advances in reinforcement learning led to many breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. Some of the latest deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been implemented in [ReinforcementLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl) with Flux. We'd like to have more interesting and practical algorithms added to enrich the whole community, including but not limited to the following directions:

* **[Easy(175h)] Recurrent version of existing algorithms**. Contributors with a basic understanding of Q-learning and recurrent neural networks are preferred. We'd like to have a general implementation to easily extend existing algorithms to the sequential version.
* **[Medium(175h)] Multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms**. Currently, we only have some CFRï¼Œ MADDPG and NFSP related algorithms implemented. We'd like to see more implemented, including [COMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926) and its variants, [PSRO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00832).
* **[Medium(350h)] Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms**. Contributors interested in this topic may refer [Model-based Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16712) and design some general interfaces to implement typical model based algorithms.
* **[Hard(350h)] Distributed reinforcement learning framework**. Inspired by [Acme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00979), a similar design is proposed in [DistributedReinforcementLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/DistributedReinforcementLearning.jl). However, it is still in a very early stage. Contributors interested in this direction are required to have a basic understanding of distributed computing in Julia. Ideally we'd like to see some distributed reinforcement learning algorithms implemented under this framework, like [R2D2](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lyTjAqYX&utm_campaign=RL%20Weekly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [D4PG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08617v1).

#### Expected Outcomes

For each new algorithm, at least two experiments are expected to be added into [ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl). A simple one to make sure it works on some toy games with CPU only and another more practical one to produce comparable results on the original paper with GPU enabled. Besides, a technical report on the implementation details and speed/performance comparison with other baselines is preferred.

### AlphaZero.jl

The philosophy of the [AlphaZero.jl](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl) project is to provide an implementation of AlphaZero that is simple enough to be widely accessible for contributors and researchers, while also being sufficiently powerful and fast to enable meaningful experiments on limited computing resources (our latest release is consistently between one and two orders of magnitude faster than competing Python implementations).

Here are a few project ideas that build on AlphaZero.jl. Please contact us for additional details and let us know about your experience and interests so that we can build a project that best suits your profile.

- [Easy (175h)] Integrate AlphaZero.jl with the [OpenSpiel](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/OpenSpiel.jl) game library and benchmark it on a series of simple board games.
- [Medium (175h)] Use AlphaZero.jl to train a chess agent. In order to save computing resources and allow faster bootstrapping, you may train an initial policy using supervised learning.
- [Hard (350h)] Build on AlphaZero.jl to implement the [MuZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules) algorithm.
- [Hard (350h)] Explore applications of AlphaZero beyond board games (e.g. theorem proving, chip design, chemical synthesis...).

#### Expected Outcomes

In all these projects, the goal is not only to showcase the current Julia ecosystem and test its limits, but also to push it forward through concrete contributions that other people can build on. Such contributions include:

- Improvements to existing Julia packages (e.g. AlphaZero, ReinforcementLearning, CommonRLInterface, Dagger, Distributed, CUDA...) through code, documentation or benchmarks.
- A well-documented and replicable artifact to be added to [AlphaZero.Examples](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl/tree/master/games), [ReinforcementLearningZoo](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl) or released in its own package.
- A blog post that details your experience, discusses the challenges you went through and identifies promising areas for future work.
