Below are the proposed projects in this area. Technical writers may wish to do a combination of these projects. The mentors for the JuliaDiffEq projects are <a href="https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas">Chris Rackauckas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kanav99">Kanav Gupta</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/isaacsas">Sam Isaacson</a>.</p> <p>Here are some possible projects:</p> <ul> <li><h3>Unified Organization Documentation</h3> </ul> <p><a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML</a> is the scientific machine learning organization. However, its documentation is spread amongst many different fairly large packages:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/latest/">DifferentialEquations.jl</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://diffeqflux.sciml.ai/dev/">DiffEqFlux.jl</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/">ModelingToolkit.jl</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/latest/">Surrogates.jl</a></p> </ul> <p>Just to name a few. One project would be to create a unified scientific machine learning documentation that would make it easy to move between all of these different package docs and understand the cohesive organization.</p> <ul> <li><h3>Tutorial Writing</h3> <p>The JuliaDiffEq organization hosts the <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqTutorials.jl">DiffEqTutorials.jl</a> repository which auto-builds websites and pdfs from tutorials. Tutorials generally center on features of DifferentialEquations.jl or on application domains. Technical writers who have expertise in areas like biological modeling may wish to contribute tutorials that showcase how to use DifferentialEquations.jl to solve problems arising in their discipline.</p> </ul> <h4 id=potential_impact ><a href="#potential_impact">Potential Impact</a></h4> <p>Many university classes use the SciML ecosystem for its teaching, and thus classrooms all over the world will be improved. Tutorials that capture more domains will allow professors teaching biological modeling courses to not have to manually rewrite physics-based tutorials to match their curriculum, and conversion of READMEs to documentation will help such professors link to reference portions for these tools in their lecture notes.</p> <p>Additionally, these benchmarks are a widely referenced cross-language benchmark of differential equations, which gives a standard between Python, R, Julia, MATLAB, and many C&#43;&#43; and Fortran packages. Improving the technical writing around the benchmarks can make this set of documents more widely accessible, and enlarging the scope of topics will help individuals of all programming languages better assess the methods they should be choosing for their problems.</p> <h2 id=flux_machine_learning ><a href="#flux_machine_learning">Flux &#40;Machine Learning&#41;</a></h2> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl">Flux.jl</a> project will be applying seperatly from the Julia umbrealla since Flux is now a NumFOCUS affiliated project. You can find the <a href="https://fluxml.ai/gsod.html">GSoD projects proposed for Flux on their wesbite</a>.</p> <h2 id=turing_probabilistic_machine_learning ><a href="#turing_probabilistic_machine_learning">Turing &#40;probabilistic machine learning&#41;</a></h2> <p><a href="https://turing.ml/dev/">Turing.jl</a> is a probabilistic programming language written in Julia. The team is looking for help with documentation and tutorials for several projects. Mentors for this project would be <a href="https://github.com/cpfiffer/">Cameron Pfiffer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trappmartin/">Martin Trapp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xukai92">Kai Xu</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/yebai/">Hong Ge</a>.</p> <p>Some ideas include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Documentation and manuals for <a href="https://github.com/TuringLang/MCMCChains.jl">MCMCChains</a>, <a href="https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedHMC.jl">AdvancedHMC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl">Bijectors</a>. Turing maintains several separate packages, all of which have some documentation, but each of these could be improved dramatically with a dedicated documentation website and better coverage of docstrings. Technical writers would review current documentation, meet with the development team for each package to determine the package goals, and assess whether current documentation meets those goals. AdvancedHMC, for example, requires a much more detailed guide that explores all of AdvancedHMC&#39;s functionality.</p> <li><p>A more comprehensive tutorial that sow how to use Turing.jl with <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferenceEquations.jl">DifferenceEquations.jl</a>. Turing has an <a href="https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/10-bayesian-differential-equations/">existing tutorial</a> that demonstrates how to perform Bayesian parameter estimation for the Lotka-Volterra model with DifferenceEquations.jl, but this is very much a toy example and does not demonstrate real-world applicability. A guide that shows how to apply Turing and Flux in a useful setting would be valuable for Julia, Turing, and Flux.</p> <li><p>A more comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use Turing with <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl">Flux.jl</a>. Turing has an <a href="https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/3-bayesnn/">existing tutorial</a> that demonstrates how to build a Bayesian neural network with Flux.jl, but this is very much a toy example and does not demonstrate real-world applicability. A guide that shows how to apply Turing and Flux in a useful setting would be valuable for Julia, Turing, and Flux. One possibility is to reproduce some results from <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/ftp/thesis.pdf">Radford Neal&#39;s PhD thesis</a>.</p> <li><p>Polishing other existing Turing tutorials. Turing currently has more than 10 tutorials at https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/ and most of them were written in early days of Turing.jl. Some of them requires an update to the latest syntax and most of them would benefit from a general writing improvement.</p> <li><p>A structured explanation of the different inference algorithms provided in Turing with details on when to use each algorithm and what are the implications of each approach. Turing has many sampling algorithms, but their value is not fully recognized by inexperienced users – heuristics on when to use which algorithms would greatly benefit the user experience. Documentation might run speed tests, or measure convergence criteria for different sampler types. One such <a href="https://dm13450.github.io/2019/04/10/Turing-Sampling-Speed.html">blog post</a> focused mostly on speed, but there are features of different models and data that make some samplers preferable to others.</p> <li><p>An introduction to probabilistic modelling and the Bayesian approach in Turing with a discussion of general Bayesian issues such as the choice of prior. Turing lacks a good resource for those who are just beginning with probabilistic modelling, and users tend to use <a href="https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_23/stan-users-guide/index.html">Stan&#39;s</a> excellent documentation or <a href="https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/">Probabilistic Programming &amp; Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a> to learn how to use probabilistic programming. Turing should be self-contained when it comes to grabbing early-phase learners.</p> </ul> <h4 id=potential_impact__2 ><a href="#potential_impact__2">Potential Impact</a></h4> <p>Turing is a rapidly developing probabilistic programming language, used by machine learning researchers, data scientists, statisticians, and economists. Improving any measure of the informational tools in Turing will allow those communities to integrate better with the Julia community, which will, in turn, improve the rest of Julia&#39;s ecosystem. Better documentation and guides will attract new learners and help to transition more experienced people from tools that do not meet their needs.</p> <h2 id=mlj_multi-paradigm_machine_learning ><a href="#mlj_multi-paradigm_machine_learning">MLJ &#40;multi-paradigm machine learning&#41;</a></h2> <p><a href="https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/">MLJ</a> &#40;Machine Learning in Julia&#41; is the most popular multi-paradigm machine learning toolbox written in the Julia language. It provides a common interface and meta-algorithms for selecting, tuning, evaluating, composing and almost 200 machine learning models written in Julia and other languages. Such models include neural networks &#40;based on the popular <a href="https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/">Flux.jl</a> package&#41; tree-based models &#40;such as random forests&#41; support vector machines, nearest neighbor models, outlier detection models, general linear models, clustering algorithms &#40;such as K-means&#41;, and more. In particular MLJ wraps a large number of models from the python toolbox <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>.</p> <p>While the the MLJ ecosystem is spread over some <a href="https://github.com/JuliaAI">two dozen repositories</a> the reference documentation is mostly collected in a <a href="https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/">single manual</a>. Additional learning resources, which include a dedicated <a href="https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/">tutorial site</a>, are listed <a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/more-doc-updates/docs/src/learning_mlj.md">here</a>.</p> <p>The reference manual is comprehensive from the point-of-view of what you can <em>do</em> with models &#40;train, tune, evaluated, combined, etc&#41; but has no model-specific documentation at all. Only some models have document strings, but these usually lack detail or examples, and do not conform to any standard.</p> <p>The present project can be divided into two parts:</p> <h3 id=model_documentation ><a href="#model_documentation"><ol> <li><p>Model documentation</p> </ol> </a></h3> <p>Create a detailed document string for each model in MLJ&#39;s model registry, as outlined in <a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/issues/913">this github issue</a>, or at least the most popular models. A key part of each document string is <strong>a short example illustrating basic usage</strong>. Most models are provided by third party packages, which generally have their own documentation, so this is often a simple matter of adapting existing documentation to MLJ syntax. </p> <p>The models wrapped from sckit-learn &#40;about 70&#41; constitute a separate case, as the available documentation is in python and not Julia. Initially, docstrings for these models will simply quote the python documentation. However, generating these <a href="https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJScikitLearnInterface.jl/issues/37">may require</a> some coding &#40;e.g., Julia macros, artifacts&#41; and so is optional for this project.</p> <h3 id=ol_start2_integration_of_model_documentation_into_the_reference_manual ><a href="#ol_start2_integration_of_model_documentation_into_the_reference_manual"><ol start=2 > <li><p>Integration of model documentation into the reference manual</p> </ol> </a></h3> <p>Models can be loosely grouped into families &#40;regressors, classifiers, clustering algorithms, etc&#41; and integrating the new document strings into the reference manual could fit into such an organization - something resembling the model documentation in <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>.</p> <h4 id=requisite_knowledge ><a href="#requisite_knowledge">Requisite knowledge</a></h4> <p>Writers will need some familiarity with basic machine learning workflows, and very basic Julia, but will also have the opportunity to develop both.</p> <h4 id=potential_impact__3 ><a href="#potential_impact__3">Potential Impact</a></h4> <p>Julia is perceived as a potential game-changer for machine learning. Current practice is dominated by platforms in python and R, but there innovation is increasingly stifled by the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02310-3">two language problem</a> solved by Julia. Good documentation is essential both to ensure MLJ.jl is an attractive option to practicing data scientists, and to those training new data scientists. </p> </div><br><br> <footer class="container-fluid footer-copy"> <div class=container > <div class="row footrow"> <ul> <li><a href="/project">About</a> <li><a href="/about/help">Get Help</a> <li><a href="/governance/">Governance</a> <li><a href="/research/#publications">Publications</a> <li><a href="/research/#sponsors">Sponsors</a> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="/downloads/">Downloads</a> <li><a href="/downloads/">All Releases</a> <li><a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia">Source Code</a> <li><a href="/downloads/#current_stable_release">Current Stable Release</a> <li><a href="/downloads/#long_term_support_release">Longterm Support Release</a> <li><a href="https://status.julialang.org/">PkgServer Status</a> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/">Documentation</a> <li><a href="https://juliaacademy.com">JuliaAcademy</a> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage">YouTube</a> <li><a href="/learning/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> <li><a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/">FAQ</a> <li><a href="/learning/books">Books</a> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="/community/">Community</a> <li><a href="/community/standards/">Code of Conduct</a> <li><a href="/diversity/">Diversity</a> <li><a href="https://juliacon.org">JuliaCon</a> <li><a href="/community/#julia_user_and_developer_survey">User/Developer Survey</a> <li><a href="/shop/">Shop Merchandise</a> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing</a> <li><a href="/contribute">Contributor's Guide</a> <li><a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues">Issue Tracker</a> <li><a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/security/policy">Report a Security Issue</a> <li><a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+language%3AJulia+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">Help Wanted Issues</a> <li><a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+language%3AJulia+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">Good First Issue</a> <li><a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/reflection/">Dev Docs</a> </ul> </div> <div id=footer-bottom  class=row > <div class="col-md-10 py-2"> <p>This site is powered by <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://franklinjl.org">Franklin.jl</a>, and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia Programming Language</a>.
